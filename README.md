# Stock Price Prediction Model

## Overview

This project aims to develop a machine learning model to predict stock prices based on historical data. The model utilizes various features extracted from the stock's historical performance to predict future prices. The project includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and deployment.

## Data

### Datasets

- **Historical Stock Prices:** The primary dataset used in this project includes historical stock prices, which contain columns such as `Date`, `Open`, `High`, `Low`, `Close`, `Volume`, and `Adj Close`.
- **External Factors:** Additional datasets that may include economic indicators, news sentiment, etc., are located in the `data/external` directory.

### Data Preprocessing

- **Missing Values:** Handle missing values by forward filling or removing them.
- **Feature Scaling:** Normalize or standardize features to improve model performance.
- **Feature Engineering:** Derived features like moving averages, RSI, MACD, etc., are used.

## Modeling Approach

### Model Selection

- **Baseline Model:** Linear Regression is used as a baseline model.
- **Advanced Models:** Models such as XGBoost, Random Forest, and LSTM are explored.

### Evaluation Metrics

- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**
- **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**
- **R-Squared**

## Installation

To run this project, you'll need to install the necessary dependencies. It's recommended to use a virtual environment.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/stock-price-prediction.git
cd stock-price-prediction
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

### Training the Model

To train the model, run:

```bash
python scripts/train_model.py --config configs/train_config.yaml
```

### Making Predictions

To make predictions on new data, run:

```bash
python scripts/predict.py --input data/new_data.csv --output predictions.csv
```

### Docker

To run the project inside a Docker container:

```bash
docker build -t stock-price-prediction .
docker run -v $(pwd):/app stock-price-prediction
```

## Results

The best-performing model achieved an RMSE of `X.XX` on the validation set. The model's predictions show a correlation of `Y.YY` with the actual stock prices.

## Future Work

- **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Further optimize the models by exploring a broader range of hyperparameters.
- **Feature Enrichment:** Incorporate more external factors like news sentiment, economic indicators, etc.
- **Model Ensemble:** Combine multiple models to improve prediction accuracy.
